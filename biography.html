<h1>üßë‚Äçüíª Biography</h1>
<hr>
<div class="biography">
<p>My name is David Korunoski, and I come from the city of Kichevo, North Macedonia. From an early age, I was passionate about football ‚Äî I trained regularly and played in the youth categories of FK Pelister. The discipline, teamwork, and dedication I developed through sports have shaped how I approach life and learning today.

    Alongside my love for sports, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by computers and technology. I grew up playing video games, experimenting with Photoshop, and even creating private servers for certain games ‚Äî all self-taught and driven by curiosity. Over time, I realized that my interests went far beyond just playing games. I was deeply interested in how things worked behind the scenes ‚Äî how servers operated, how interfaces were designed, and how code brought everything to life.

    After finishing high school, I decided to pursue that passion further and enrolled at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI) in Skopje, majoring in Applied Information Technologies. This field allows me to combine my creativity, logical thinking, and technical interests. Studying at FINKI has been both challenging and rewarding ‚Äî it‚Äôs pushing me to grow not only as a student but as a future developer.

    My ultimate goal is to become a skilled programmer and contribute to meaningful tech projects. I‚Äôm particularly interested in areas like web development, software engineering, and game technology. I believe that through dedication, continuous learning, and a genuine love for what I do, I can make a lasting impact in the world of technology.</p>
