<div class="biography">
    <p>Currently, I am pursuing my studies at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI) in Skopje, North Macedonia, where I am specializing in Applied Information Technologies. I began my studies in 2023, and throughout my time at FINKI, I have been gaining knowledge in various aspects of IT, including software development, web technologies, databases, and problem-solving techniques. My focus is on acquiring a well-rounded set of technical skills that will help me excel as a future software engineer.

        <br><br>Before enrolling at FINKI, I attended the State High School, the Sports Academy in Bitola, where I was able to develop a strong academic foundation alongside my passion for sports. Being part of the Sports Academy not only allowed me to nurture my athletic abilities but also taught me valuable life skills, such as discipline, teamwork, and perseverance ‚Äî qualities that continue to shape my approach to education and professional growth.

        <br><br>In addition to my formal education, I have actively pursued self-improvement in the English language. I have completed several courses in English, ranging from intermediate to advanced levels (C1, C2, B1, B2). These courses have significantly enhanced my ability to communicate fluently in English, which is crucial in the tech field as it enables me to collaborate with international teams, understand global tech trends, and broaden my professional opportunities.

        <br><br>Through my education, I am constantly striving to build a solid foundation in both technical and soft skills, with the goal of becoming a proficient programmer and making meaningful contributions to the world of technology.</p></div></body>
